# **Personalized Student Recommendation System**  

## **Overview**  
The **Personalized Student Recommendation System** is an AI-driven approach to analyzing students' quiz performance and providing targeted recommendations for improvement. This system evaluates quiz responses, identifies weak areas, and suggests strategic learning paths to enhance subject understanding.  

## **Features**  
- **Quiz Performance Analysis** – Computes student accuracy across multiple topics.  
- **Student Persona Identification** – Categorizes students based on strengths and weaknesses.  
- **Personalized Recommendations** – Provides tailored suggestions to improve subject proficiency.  
- **Performance Visualization** – Graphical insights into quiz performance trends.
