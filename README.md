# **Personalized Student Recommendation System**  

## **Overview**  
The **Personalized Student Recommendation System** is an AI-driven approach to analyzing students' quiz performance and providing targeted recommendations for improvement. This system evaluates quiz responses, identifies weak areas, and suggests strategic learning paths to enhance subject understanding.  

## **Features**  
- **Quiz Performance Analysis** – Computes student accuracy across multiple topics.  
- **Student Persona Identification** – Categorizes students based on strengths and weaknesses.  
- **Personalized Recommendations** – Provides tailored suggestions to improve subject proficiency.  
- **Performance Visualization** – Graphical insights into quiz performance trends.  

Here’s a **detailed approach description** you can include in your README:

### **Approach Description**  

Our **Personalized Student Recommendation System** is designed to analyze student quiz performance and provide customized insights for improvement. The project follows a structured workflow:  

#### **1. Data Processing**  
- Extracts relevant details from **Current Quiz Data** (latest quiz attempt) and **Historical Quiz Data** (previous attempts).  
- Cleans and preprocesses the dataset to ensure consistency.  
- Maps quiz responses to corresponding **topics, difficulty levels, and accuracy rates**.  

#### **2. Performance Analysis**  
- Computes **overall accuracy** across all quizzes.  
- Breaks down performance by **topic**, identifying strengths and weaknesses.  
- Tracks **trends in accuracy**, detecting improvements or declines in specific areas.  

#### **3. Student Persona Identification**  
- Categorizes the student based on their performance trends.  
- Assigns a **persona label** (e.g., "Emerging Talent," "Potential Learner") to provide meaningful insights.  
- Highlights specific **strengths and areas needing improvement** based on historical accuracy.  

#### **4. Personalized Recommendations**  
- Generates tailored study recommendations:  
  - Topics requiring **extra focus**.  
  - Areas where performance is **declining**.  
  - Strong topics where consistency should be maintained.  
  - Suggested **difficulty levels and question types** for targeted practice.
